TODO LIST
URGENT:
- add - sign in computing 4\pi G \rho and in computing g overall results won't be affected
- make sure of sing of forcing terms of magnetic anomalies
- simulataneous runs are not possible due to write/read of identical files on tmp/ folder
- properly nondimensionalize okada solution part
- properly nondimensionalize traction/ubc conditions
- replace block properties with elemental propertie for viscoelastic region
NONURGENT
 - we can unify varible name elmt_finite
 - Robin boundary condition
 - need to consider ghost partitions for the averaging nodal quantities
 - block visualization so that interior part can be clearly visualized
 - isolate constitutive relation part
 - restart feature
 - YAML input format 
 - Prompt error if the input and/or output and/or partition paths are not found.
RECENTLY RESOLVED
- replace conditions controlled by block material properties with point properties
